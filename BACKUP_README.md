# BizWorx Backup - Working State

## Backup Details
- **Date**: June 15, 2025 14:22 UTC
- **Status**: Fully functional authentication and data handling
- **Database**: Complete with business and user data

## What's Working
- ✅ Business registration flow
- ✅ Admin PIN setup process
- ✅ Two-step authentication (business email/password → user PIN)
- ✅ Data handling for clients and jobs pages
- ✅ API response wrapper extraction
- ✅ Black background styling
- ✅ All existing business data preserved

## Current Login Credentials
- **Business Email**: mtnmike89@gmail.com
- **Business Password**: BodavsDmr21@
- **Admin PIN**: 1234

## Key Fixes Applied
1. Fixed query client to extract data from `{success: true, data: [...]}` response structure
2. Added Array.isArray() validation to prevent frontend filter errors
3. Completed admin user setup for existing "Flatline Earthworks" business
4. Updated login flow to handle setupMode responses correctly
5. Fixed form control warnings with proper default values
