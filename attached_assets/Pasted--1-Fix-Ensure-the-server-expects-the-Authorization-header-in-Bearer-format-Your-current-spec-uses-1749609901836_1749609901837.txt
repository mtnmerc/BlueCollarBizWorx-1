✅ 1. Fix: Ensure the server expects the Authorization header in Bearer format
Your current spec uses:

json
Copy
Edit
"securitySchemes": {
  "BearerAuth": {
    "type": "apiKey",
    "in": "header",
    "name": "Authorization"
  }
}
✅ This is correct for ChatGPT — ChatGPT will send:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
📌 But your server must actually expect this format.

If your server is using something like:

js
Copy
Edit
const token = req.headers['authorization'];
Then make sure you’re checking that it starts with Bearer :

js
Copy
Edit
if (token && token.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
  const apiKey = token.slice(7);
  // Compare apiKey with expected
}
✅ 2. Fix: Make sure your API key is pasted correctly into ChatGPT
When setting up the API key in your GPT’s API settings, you must paste it like this:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Bearer sk_live_your_actual_api_key_here
If you just paste:

nginx
Copy
Edit
sk_live_your_actual_api_key_here
❌ It won’t work — because your OpenAPI expects the key in a header named Authorization.

✅ 3. Fix: Confirm your Replit server is actually reading the Authorization header
Replit apps sometimes need CORS/headers explicitly set. Check this in your Express.js (or similar) code:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Authorization, Content-Type");
  next();
});
Otherwise, ChatGPT might send the Authorization header but Replit won’t pass it through.

✅ 4. Optional: Add a test /debug-auth endpoint
You’ve already defined /api/gpt/debug. Make sure the handler looks like this:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/api/gpt/debug", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    success: true,
    headers: req.headers,
    message: "Authorization headers received."
  });
});
Then you can test in ChatGPT and see what headers it's sending.

✅ 5. Confirm with a simple test using Postman or curl
Before trusting ChatGPT's call, do a manual test:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X GET https://bluecollarbizworx.replit.app/api/gpt/debug \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_actual_api_key_here"
If that fails — it's a backend issue. If it works — ChatGPT likely isn't sending the token right.

✅ Summary Checklist for 403 Fix
✅ Step	Check
OpenAPI Authorization header uses apiKey	✔️ Done
API key pasted as Bearer <KEY> in ChatGPT	❗ Double check
Server code expects Authorization with Bearer prefix	❗ Confirm logic
CORS allows Authorization header in Replit	❗ Required
Use /api/gpt/debug to inspect received headers	✔️ Smart addition
