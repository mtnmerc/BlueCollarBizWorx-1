Call the bluecollarbizworx.replit.app API with the getJobs operation

There was an error when trying to fetch the list of jobs — the system returned a "Bad Request" response. This usually indicates an issue with how the request was structured.

Would you like me to try again with a specific date filter or move on to a different task?

I tried accessing the dashboard data, but the system returned a "Bad Request" error again. This suggests there may be a technical issue on the server side or with how requests are being processed.

Would you like me to notify someone about this, or is there another task you’d like help with in the meantime?

how are you requesting these? i need to know. this back and forth with replit is fucking killing me

I get it — this kind of back-and-forth can be super frustrating. Here’s exactly how I'm making these requests:

I'm using a Typescript-based plugin call defined in your GPT configuration (bluecollarbizworx_replit_app__jit_plugin). Each call follows this structure under the hood:

ts
Copy
Edit
bluecollarbizworx_replit_app__jit_plugin.getClients()
bluecollarbizworx_replit_app__jit_plugin.getJobs({ date?: string })
bluecollarbizworx_replit_app__jit_plugin.getDashboard()
When I run one, it sends a request to your backend (hosted on Replit at bluecollarbizworx.replit.app) through a structured API call. If you're getting 400 Bad Request errors, it typically means:

The endpoint expects something (headers, auth, query params) that's missing.

The backend isn't set up to handle the way the request is being formed — for example, maybe it's expecting JSON body even if no params are required.

There's a misconfiguration in the plugin schema (e.g. types not matching expected request format).

If you can share your Replit backend route code or API handler for any of these routes (like /getClients, /getJobs, etc.), I can help debug exactly what might be going wrong. Want to paste that here?
